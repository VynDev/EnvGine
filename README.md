**Experimental!**

This simple 2D game engine aim to create multiple environments that run at the same time (mainly for my AI training purpose).  
  
Currently in development and will probably be improved if I do projects that need it.

# What you will find in this engine

- Environments (multithreaded) system
- Entity system
- Render system

# What you currently won't find in this engine

- Physics & Collisions system
- Networking system
- Editor
- A lot of features that you would usually find in a real game engine
